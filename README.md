Usage: sub
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't sub, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
___
 7. div
#advanced
Implement the div opcode.

The div opcode

The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: div
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't div, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
___
 8. mul
#advanced
Implement the mul opcode.

The mul opcode

The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

Usage: mul
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mul, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
___
 9. mod
#advanced
Implement the mod opcode.

The mod opcode

The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: mod
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mod, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
___
 10. comments
#advanced
Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).
___
 11. pchar
#advanced
Implement the pchar opcode.

The pchar opcode

The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pchar
The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
If the value is not in the ascii table (man ascii) print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, value out of range, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
___
 12. pstr
#advanced
Implement the pstr opcode.

The pstr opcode

The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pstr
The integer stored in each element of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
The string stops when either:
the stack is over
the value of the element is 0
the value of the element is not in the ascii table
If the stack is empty, print only a new line.
___
 13. rotl
#advanced
Implement the rotl opcode.

The rotl opcode

The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

Usage: rotl
The top element of the stack becomes the last one, and the second top element of the stack becomes the first one
rotl never fails
___
 14. rotr
#advanced
Implement the rotr opcode.

The rotr opcode

The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

Usage: rotr
The last element of the stack becomes the top element of the stack
rotr never fails
___
 15. stack, queue
#advanced
Implement the stack and queue opcodes.

The stack opcode

The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

Usage: stack
The queue opcode

The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

Usage: queue
When switching mode:

The top of the stack becomes the front of the queue
The front of the queue becomes the top of the stack
___
 16. Brainf*ck
#advanced
Write a _Brainf*ck_ script that prints School, followed by a new line.

All your Brainf*ck files should be stored inside the bf sub directory
You can install the bf interpreter to test your code: sudo apt-get install bf
Read: Brainf*ck
___
 17. Add two digits
#advanced
Add two digits given by the user.

Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result
The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)
___
 18. Multiplication
#advanced
Multiply two digits given by the user.
